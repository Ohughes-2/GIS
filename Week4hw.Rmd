## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
print('Okay!! I Want to Load the World Data and Gender Inequality Data, Make a New Column
      Displaying the Difference Between 2010 and 2019, Save to GitHub, and Add my GitHub
      URL to the spreadsheet')
print('The First Step is to Load the Packeges that I Think I Might Need')
library(sf)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
print("Let's read these files")
gen_ineq <- st_read(here('HDR25_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv'))
paices <- st_read(here('World_Countries/World_Countries_Generalized.shp'))
```

```{r}
print("Let's inspect the data")
view(gen_ineq)
plot(paices)
```
```{r}
```
